        title: "Leonardo Da Vinci, Mona Lisa, 1503-19",
        description: "Painted between 1503 and 1517, Da Vinci's alluring portrait has been dogged by two questions since the day it was made: Who's the subject and why is she smiling? A number of theories for the former have been proffered over the years: That she's the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo (ergo, the work's alternative title, La Gioconda); that she's Leonardo's mother, Caterina, conjured from Leonardo's boyhood memories of her; and finally, that it's a self-portrait in drag. As for that famous smile, its enigmatic quality has driven people crazy for centuries. Whatever the reason, Mona Lisa's look of preternatural calm comports with the idealized landscape behind her, which dissolves into the distance through Leonardo's use of atmospheric perspective."

        title: "Johannes Vermeer, Girl with a Pearl Earring, 1665",
        description: "Johannes Vermeer's 1665 study of a young woman is startlingly real and startlingly modern, almost as if it were a photograph. This gets into the debate over whether or not Vermeer employed a pre-photographic device called a camera obscura to create the image. Leaving that aside, the sitter is unknown, though it's been speculated that she might have been Vermeer's maid. He portrays her looking over her shoulder, locking her eyes with the viewer as if attempting to establish an intimate connection across the centuries. Technically speaking, Girl isn't a portrait, but rather an example of the Dutch genre called a tronie—a headshot meant more as still life of facial features than as an attempt to capture a likeness."

        title: "Vincent van Gogh, The Starry Night, 1889",
        description: "Vincent Van Gogh's most popular painting, The Starry Night was created by Van Gogh at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he'd committed himself in 1889. Indeed, The Starry Night seems to reflect his turbulent state of mind at the time, as the night sky comes alive with swirls and orbs of frenetically applied brush marks springing from the yin and yang of his personal demons and awe of nature."

        title: "Gustav Klimt, The Kiss, 1907-1908",
        description: "Opulently gilded and extravagantly patterned, The Kiss, Gustav Klimt's fin-de-siècle portrayal of intimacy, is a mix of Symbolism and Vienna Jugendstil, the Austrian variant of Art Nouveau. Klimt depicts his subjects as mythical figures made modern by luxuriant surfaces of up-to-the moment graphic motifs. The work is a highpoint of the artist's Golden Phase between 1899 and 1910 when he often used gold leaf—a technique inspired by a 1903 trip to the Basilica di San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy, where he saw the church's famed Byzantine mosaics."
